# ðŸ§  Multiple Disease Prediction System

A machine learning-powered web app built with **Streamlit** to predict the likelihood of two common diseases:

- **Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**

This application enables users to enter health parameters and receive instant predictions using trained machine learning models.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Simple and interactive UI using **Streamlit**
- Sidebar navigation with `streamlit-option-menu`
- Real-time prediction based on user inputs
- ML models trained with **scikit-learn**
- Easy to extend and customize

## ðŸ§ª Models Used

- `diabetes_model.sav`: Predicts diabetes from features like glucose level, BMI, age, pregnancies, etc.
- `heart_model.sav`: Predicts heart disease based on cholesterol, resting blood pressure, max heart rate, and more.

All models are saved using `joblib` and are trained on well-known public datasets.
